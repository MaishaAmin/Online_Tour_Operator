\textbf{\Large Challenge}

\begin{itemize}

\item
    Creating a user friendly UI will be a challenge. UI needs to be simple and easy so that everyone can easily use the site.

  Any fraud, the third party may misuse this platform. Again, there are
  possibilities a group of people may buy the tickets and resell them.
  It is tough to verify the authentic customer or any fraud group of
  people.
\item
  The enormous amount of data is challenging to manage. Overall, the
  maintenance cost, profit, quick service, and verifying all the
  information are complex.
  
\item

  Providing security for online payment will be challenging too.
    
    
\item
  Authentication of the tour guides. It is quite difficult to verify
  the tour guides if they are fraud or not.~
